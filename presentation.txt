what you expect to be hard and what was actually hard:

original idea was to check the GPS tracker, seemed like a lot of reverse engineering
just used this petfinder api instead
    (seems like someone beat us to the idea, but we will persevere)

+ its doable to get started with this stuff
+ straightfoward
    account on skill side
    then hosting-- AWS lambda was easy
    tutorials

- tutorials haven't aged the best-- doesn't match the way you'd like
    its in there just not in the same order

- parts of the API are cumbersome
    custom slots in particular
        can't see IDs with testing tool / wierd resolution authority stuff

- reporting results in spoken text is much more work than with

    glimpses of technology I want to explore further
     node environment seems like a nice place for experimenting with stuff
        been working in "work environment", all plugging stuff in-- "never spinning stuff up from scratch"


not a good fit
